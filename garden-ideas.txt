how do we turn a directory into a garden?
* html is the medium

extensionless files are rendered as plaintext.

all files except for extensionless files are links. files are plants.
* directories are links, denoted with a trailing forward slash.
* regular files are links.
* extensionless files are treated as raw text.
filename and file information (e.g. size) should always be shown.
* directories show the number of items in it
* files show filesize
* deal with recursion later
* the name "index.html" may be reserved.

some rich files show additional information.
* media such as photos, videos, audio, show the information as html equivalents
* render markdown?

viewing
* dotfiles are hidden by default
* .gitignore is understood
* .gardenignore is respected
* .DS_Store is esteemed
the default garden directory is simply "garden".
* you should be able to start a garden from anywhere, though.

there are two views: 1) freeform and 2) grid/gallery. this is determined by the info in .DS_Store
* sorry, windows users

FREEFORM (or "NATURAL".)
* if directory in finder is "icons" and sort by "none", read .DS_Store info on how to place elements.

otherwise, (or if there is no .DS_STORE),
GRID/GALLERY (or "FORMAL")
* as determined by filename lexicographical order
