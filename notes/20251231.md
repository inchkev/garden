Happy last day of 2025.

I've given my neglected blog ([https://blog.kevin.garden](https://blog.kevin.garden))
a slight facelift and christened it with its first proper entry, a recipe for almond
sugar cookies.

Plus various style & backend rendering improvements...
- Wikipedia style references and backlinks! Aria labels match too..
- Added colors brown and magenta, from my other sites
- Fix edge cases with empty filenames/slugs, empty title, etc.
- Arbitrary front matter properties are easier to set and no longer require
updating code

Also, the reason I haven't been updating the Finder screenshot is
because I upgraded to Tahoe and file icons look ugly to me.
