Happy new year.

My newfound energy has me continuing to work on my "blog".

I've moved the url from blog.kevin.garden to [p.kevin.garden](https://p.kevin.garden).
It's shorter, which I like, and it also looks more visually interesting.
I chose the letter "p" because it creates the acronym "p.k.g" from the url. p.k.g is short for "package".
- [.pkg (package)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.pkg) is "a filename extension used for several file formats that contain packages of software and other files" (Wikipedia).
- I like the word package.
- I use software packages.
- I enjoy receiving packages.
- For four months, I kept every package that I received in the mail. For each package, I cut out and scanned every graphical element found on it (shipping labels, codes, stickers).
