Bought two bookshelves from [Books and Bookshelves](https://booksandbookshelves.com/) today. They're a used book and comic shop who also sells custom-made wood shelves and chairs. The two I got today are unfinished pine. I think they're pine (I forgot to ask) since the wood smelled like pine needles when I sprayed the surface to raise the grain before sanding.

I'm hoping that I have enough remaining poly topcoat (I use [General Finishes'](https://generalfinishes.com/wood-finishes-retail/water-based-topcoats-and-sanding-sealer/high-performance-polyurethane-water)) from when I finished my bed frame.

Right now I'm thinking about where the best place to host my thoughts (blogs? posts? notes? logs?) would be, since I'm not sure the form they'll even take. If I'm doing short notes like the one you're readingâ€”kevin.garden makes sense. But, if I want to write longer-form formatted entries, proper markdown support and some off-the-shelf framework would be better than anything I can come up with. God forbid I burn out before even having written any entries, through attempting to write my own markdown -> static site generator. Oh, and being able to inline images would also be very nice.
