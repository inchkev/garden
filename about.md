kevin.garden is my personal file gallery, currently fixated on my photos.

kevin.garden is a mirror of the underlying directory that hosts it. html pages<br>
are created by a script ([cultivate.js](https://kevin.garden/src/cultivate.js)) that visits every file and parses their<br>
file coordinates within the finder directory using data found in macOS's<br>
.DS_Store file. here, .DS_Store is a file that is finally esteemed.

view the source images, files, and more at [github.com/inchkev/garden](https://github.com/inchkev/garden).<br>
the repository paratactically hosts my personal kevin.garden, viewable<br>
here, with the files and code that host and generate it. the .gardenignore<br>
denylist prevents files such as .gitignore and node_modules/ from<br>
being shown.

kevin.garden lays almost everything bare: [src/](https://kevin.garden/src/) contains the source code,<br>
and [views/](https://kevin.garden/views/) the .ejs templates that define the .htmls.
