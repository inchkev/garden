kevin.garden is my personal file gallery, fixated on the photos i've taken.

kevin.garden is also a mirror image of the underlying directory that hosts it:<br>
html pages are generated by a program that crawls every file and parses<br>
their actual finder positions within the directory.

view—and feel free to fork—the source code at [github.com/inchkev/garden](https://github.com/inchkev/garden).<br>
the repository paratactically hosts my personal kevin.garden, viewable<br>
here, and the files and code that host and generate it. the .gardenignore<br>
denylist prevents files such as favicon.png, CNAME, and node_modules/<br>
from being shown.
