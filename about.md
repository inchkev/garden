kevin.garden is my personal file gallery, currently fixated on my garden.

kevin.garden is a mirror of the underlying directory that hosts it. html pages<br>
are created by a script ([cultivate.js](https://kevin.garden/src/cultivate.js)) that visits every file and parses their<br>
file coordinates within the finder directory using data stored in macOS's<br>
.DS_Store file. here, .DS_Store is a file that is finally esteemed.

view the source images, files, and more at [github.com/inchkev/garden](https://github.com/inchkev/garden).<br>
the repository paratactically hosts my personal kevin.garden, viewable<br>
here, with the files and code that host and generate it. the .gardenignore<br>
denylist prevents files such as .gitignore and node_modules/ from<br>
being shown.

kevin.garden lays almost everything bare: [src/](src/) the source code, [views/](views/) the<br>
templates that generate what you're seeing, [favicon.png](favicon.png) the favicon, etc.

kevin.garden is a [file.gallery](https://file.gallery) by [kevin chen](https://kevinnchen.com).
