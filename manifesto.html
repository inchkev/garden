    If design is a process and to be a designer a way of thinking then it must have started years ago. When people say influences I think of the ones who have influenced me in ways impossible to fully comprehend, like my parents and how I was raised or the people I surround myself with and why.

    <b>If nothing matters, then everything does.</b> It took being 19 and living away from home for the first time for me to suddenly start internalizing this. I took being 20, when I was a junior, for me to take my first design course at Yale despite all the evidence of my love for it having existed since middle school. I am now 21 and rushing to take all the design courses this institution offers in the hopes that it will inspire rather than discourage, because it must have been burnout from packing my schedule with too many computer science courses that enabled me to pursue design in the first place. But how do I prevent burnout?

    <b>If everything matters, then nothing does.</b> Once you insist that every detail must be explicable, that every decision must be justifiable, you are probably using it as a coping mechanism. Once you become engrossed with only the details it becomes even scarier to confront the larger picture. A plant is nice, but a garden is beautiful.

    I am a person easily distracted, fixated, demotivated, hesitant. I can’t define my creative process yet because I lack experience. I am beginning to trust the process but I wish I knew why.  The following list is for me, because I need instructions on how to grow a garden lest I burn out again. These are processes I ascribe to mixed with processes I aspire to.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The only rule is work.
      </li>
      <li>
      Keep your influences close to you. Photograph any and all things that you find interesting. Or mundane. The act alone builds a habit of looking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep your influences far from you. Do not let mimicry become idolatry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gather, because the simple act of collection forces you to contextualize your surroundings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shuffle. Change is good.
      </li>
      <li>
      Liberally use extensions of the mind: writing, drawing, typing. Write and draw before typing. Keyboards and screens that demand you peck and drag frustrate easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always have blank paper to write on.
      </li>
      <li>
      Have good posture. Stretch your arms. Do not screw up your wrists.
      </li>
      <li>
        Appreciate the details. Look at the modern world around you and recognize the human effort behind everything. Everything is intentional. Everything you do is intentional, but don't dwell on that. Take nothing for granted.
      </li>
      <li>
      Fixating is fine until it turns into comfort. Rabbit holes are fine and obsessions valuable bouts of self-motivation. But ask yourself why you may be returning to the same processes. Is it more than just comfort, perhaps even avoidance? Stop being so risk averse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stop catastrophizing. You are indecisive. Recognize why first.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean up your surroundings every once in a while.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read, write, write about readings, read about writing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save as much information as possible. Data is invaluable so keep some for yourself.
      </li>

        Ruthlessly edit. This list is probably bloated.
